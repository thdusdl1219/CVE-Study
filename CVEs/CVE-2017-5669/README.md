| CVE-2017-5669 | 4.6 | The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which allows local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget and shmat system calls in a privileged context. | http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96754, http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037918, https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192931, https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e1d35d4dc7f089e6c9c080d556feedf9c706f0c7 |
