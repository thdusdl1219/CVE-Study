| CVE-2016-9644 | 9.3 | The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux kernel 4.4.22 through 4.4.28 contains extended asm statements that are incompatible with the exception table, which allows local users to obtain root access on non-SMEP platforms via a crafted application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of incorrect backporting of the CVE-2016-9178 patch to older kernels. | http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/07/4, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94545, http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-3146-1, http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-3146-2, https://lwn.net/Articles/705220/ |
