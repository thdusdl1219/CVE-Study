# CVE-2017-11176


| CVE id | CVSS | Summary | reference |
| :----- | :--- | :------ | :-------- |
| CVE-2017-11176 | 10.0 | The mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact. | http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f991af3daabaecff34684fd51fac80319d1baad1, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99919, https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f991af3daabaecff34684fd51fac80319d1baad1 |


## STUDY

If netlink_attachskb function's return value is 1, in the function, it release (free) the socket and try to retry(repeat lookup). However, in the small window (:1240 ~ 1241), if the file was released by user space, the execution path goes to out label and calls netlink_detachskb function. The netlink_detachskb function also calls sock_put(free socket) function.
